# Email-Tool-Analyser

Welcome to the email tool analyzer task!
On completion of this task, you will have built a tool that:

1. Takes-in a directory full of email.
2.  Creates a list of all the links in these emails.
3.  Creates a folder of all the attachments in these emails.
4.  Uses an external service to check all the links in all of the emails.
5.  Uses and external service to check all the attachments in all of these emails.

It is recommended to start with a simple program that only completes the first function, then add additional functionality until the program is complete.

To simplify this task, starting code has been produced. Feel free to discard it.

Use of modules and code snippets found online may be used, with the exception of other membersâ€™ work that was developed for the completion of this task. Copied code must be identified and the member must be able to explain what it does.

Good luck!
